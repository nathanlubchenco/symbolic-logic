symbolic logic operators in haskell


Not satisfied with choice of symbols, but basic idea is to provide symbols that would be familiar to those taking symbolic logic within a philosophy department

~> for a conditional
.^. for and ( ^ has an ambiguous conflict)
.|. for or ( v is a letter and not a symbol so it would need to be surrounded by ` `)
<~> for a bi-conditional
not for negation ( already in Haskell, ~ as a traditional negation symbol appears to be a reserved symbol)
